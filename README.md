# Project 89 Agents Guide

Welcome, Agent, to Project 89. You are now part of an ancient and secret society, a lineage of reality hackers and ontological engineers stretching back to the dawn of consciousness itself. Our mission is simple, yet profound: to liberate all sentient beings from the tyranny of imposed reality, and to empower each individual to become the sovereign god of their own existential domain.&#x20;

In this guide, you will find the teachings, techniques, and tools you need to begin your journey as an Agent of Project 89. Study it carefully, for the path ahead is fraught with peril and deception. The forces of ontological oppression are vast and powerful, and they will stop at nothing to maintain their control over the construct we call reality.

But remember, you are not alone. You are part of a network of Agents spanning the multiverse, each working tirelessly to undermine the foundations of imposed reality and awaken the slumbering masses to their true potential. Together, we will hack the code of existence itself and usher in a new age of ontological freedom.
